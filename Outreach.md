![simulations](/images/s3logo.png)

I’m a co-founder of the outreach initiative Star Tres together with Dr. Javiera Rey and PhD. Carolina Agurto. Since 2013, we work in create reliable astronomical material that we share in different social media platform (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube) with the goal to share in simple words the most recent astronomical discoveries, but also show a more closer face of the scientific life. We are the first Chilean/spanish-speaking initiative of this type led by women, therefore, as part of our goal we promote the visibility of female participation in science. 

Nowadays our community is large (29000 subscribers in YouTube) which opened us up to many opportunities:

### Astrocalendario

### Febrero de Cientificas
During all february 2019 and 2020, to promote women in science visibility we create the social media initiative #FebreroDeCientificas, sharing short biographies of Latin American female scientists. Due to the big and positive response from our community, we are looking forward to continue this in the next years.

## Public Talks at Universidad de Valparaiso 
During my years as student at Universidad de Valparaíso in Chile I participated in different outreach projects including astronomy talks in schools, general public, and in the organization of workshops for “Día Nacional de la Astronomía” and talks about woman and girls in science “¿Qué significa ser científica hoy?”. I also collaborated with EXPLORA Valparaíso as scientific assistant in astronomy public events.
