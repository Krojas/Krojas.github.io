I'm a chilean astronomer. I got my Phd in astrophysics at Universidad de Valparaiso, Chile in 2017. My research is focus in the understanding of the Universe using Gravitational Lensing. I'm currently a posdoctoral research at EPFL, Switzerland focus in lens finding using artifical intelligence in the frame of EUCLID telescope projects.
