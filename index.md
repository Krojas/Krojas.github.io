##### I am a Chilean postdoctoral research and science communicator. I am currently working at  Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland. I got my Ph.D. in astrophysics at Universidad de Valparaiso, Chile in 2018. I am an alumni of the program LSSTC Data Science fellowship (2nd cohort). My research is focused on the understanding of the Universe using the gravitational lensing effect. My current project is focused on the search of new gravitational lens systems using artificial intelligence. The main idea is to learn how efficiently to search for these objects in available ground base data in preparation for the new avalanche of data that LSST and Euclid telescope will provide.
