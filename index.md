##### I'm a chilean postdoctoral research working at  Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland. I got my Ph.D. in astrophysics at Universidad de Valparaiso, Chile in 2018. I'm alumni of the program LSSTC Data Science fellowship (2nd cohort). My research is focus in the understanding of the Universe using the gravitational lensing effect. My current project is focus in the search of new gravitational lens systems using artificial intelligence. The main idea is to learn how efficiently to search for this objects in available ground base data in preparation to new avalanch of data that LSST and Euclid telescope will provide.
